I tried first time to check how's FlareOn CTF Challenges going to be. Believe me they are amazing for RE lovers.

I've solved just 4/12 but that is very great experience altogether. 

Challenges involved 
1. Windows Binaries (dnSpy)
2. Mobile Application (Android) (JDGUI, APKtool)
3. Windows Binary (Ghidra/Immunity Debugger)
4. Linux Binary (Ghidra/IDA/Python Fu)
